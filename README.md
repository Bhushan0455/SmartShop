🛍️ SmartShop – AI Powered Brand Detection & Smart Price Comparison

🚀 Problem Statement

Online shoppers often see products in real life (stores, ads, social media) but:
They don’t know the exact brand/model.
They spend time manually searching across multiple platforms.
They miss better deals on other websites.
This results in time loss, price confusion, and poor purchase decisions.

📸 Takes an uploaded product image
🧠 Uses Deep Learning (MobileNetV2) to detect the product brand
🔎 Automatically searches for that product on e-commerce platforms
